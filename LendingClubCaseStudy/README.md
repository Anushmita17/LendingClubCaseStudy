Business Problem: Identifying patterns that indicate a high likelihood of loan default.
Dataset: Loan data from 2007 to 2011 including variables like loan status, loan amount, interest rate, borrower attributes, etc.
Conclusions
High interest rates and lower incomes are strong indicators of loan default.
Larger loan amounts have a higher likelihood of default.
Clear distinctions in repayment behavior based on borrower profiles.
Implementing risk-based pricing and stricter approval criteria for high-risk profiles can reduce credit losses.
